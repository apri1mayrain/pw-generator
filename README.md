      <li>Alerts user when validation fails and requires they start over</li></ul>
</ul>

## Deployment

GitHub Pages site: https://apri1mayrain.github.io/pw-generator

## Usage
You can click on the "Generate Password" button to start the process of generating a password. There will be one prompt and four confirmation pop-ups to decide the length and complexity of your new password. The prompt asks for the password length (must be 8-128 characters long) and the confirmations decide the use of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Finally, this information generates a password using a random number generation algorithm.

Tip: the more options confirmed, the stronger your password will be.
