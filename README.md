## Features

<ul>

  <li>Utilizes all special characters, with the exception of whitespace, <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters">provided by the OWASP Foundation</a></li>
  <li>User input validation:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>Logs validated information</li>
      <li>Alerts user when validation fails</li></ul>
</ul>

## Usage

You can click on the red "Generate Password" button to start the process of generating a password. There will be one prompt and four confirmation pop-ups to decide the length and complexity of your new password. The prompt asks for the password length (must be 8-128 characters long) and the confirmations decide the use of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Finally, this information will be used to generate a random password.

Tip: the more options confirmed, the stronger your password will be.
